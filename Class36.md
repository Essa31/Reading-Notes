## Whiteboard Interviews

### Communicate


This means that whatever your doing, and what ever your thinking about, always try to keep the interviewer updated, so they can understand your thought process, and analyze your problem solving skills.

* Take a few minutes.
What most of those well-meaning advice-givers overlook, however, is that talking and thinking at the same time is extremely hard. Nervous interviewees will jump straight into talking, passing up a great opportunity for concentrated thought.

Don’t waste precious minutes trying to fill the silence by saying everything you’re thinking, while simultaneously trying to solve the problem in your head.

Instead, wait until the interviewer is done explaining the problem.

* Write down the steps of the solution.
Even after you have an idea of how to attack the problem, don’t start writing code down. Write down the general steps of how you will solve it on one side of the whiteboard, where it’s visible but won’t get in the way. You don’t need to be verbose, just get the steps in order and somewhat readable.



* Write pseudocode first.

Often we run into problems halfway through writing the code, and there’s no point wasting time over syntax when you might have to throw the code away. Instead, write some half-baked code-looking stuff that lays out the structure of how your code will work. Do it over on the side of the whiteboard, so you have space left to work.

* Don’t sweat the small stuff.

Programming interviews are not about how well you’ve remembered your semicolons, nor are they about being able to remember all of the flags on a TCP packet. They’re about demonstrating depth and breadth of knowledge, personality strengths, and problem-solving abilities. If you make a mistake, it’s okay. Brush it off and move on.

* Sit down. Be humble.

A programming interview isn’t just a written exam. It’s an assessment of your programming abilities, and there are plenty of things that fall into that category beyond mere coding prowess.


* Come prepared.

* Review your work.

You won’t always finish questions in the time permitted, but occasionally you’ll have extra time after coming up with a solution.

If you have the time, review your code as you would in a peer review. Show the interviewer that you are committed to producing accurate, high-quality work, and that they can trust you to do so without being prompted.
