## Whiteboard Interviews

### Communicate

- First, Restate the Question

Do you understand what theyâ€™re asking you to do? Prove it. Restate the question for them and seek affirmation. You might actually be surprised to find you donâ€™t fully understand what theyâ€™re asking forâ€ٹâ€”â€ٹperhaps the question is similar, but not the same, as a practice problem you have completed in the past.

- Ask About Edge Cases

Think for a bit about the inputs and expected output and think about potential edge cases to the problem. Ask about them.

- Ask About Test Cases

This is free, and you should take advantage of it. Simply ask if there are any test cases that the function should pass. Your interviewer might be expecting you to ask this question, so it might be necessary. But itâ€™s also possible the interviewer was not expecting the question and will think â€œah, this candidate knows about testing!â€‌

- Write Pseudocode and Ask If It Makes Sense

Again, you donâ€™t actually want to start writing code in an actual language. Youâ€™ll find yourself constrained by trying to remember the methods or other idiosyncrasies of the language rather than trying to come up with the correct logic. Instead, let your interviewer know youâ€™re going to start by writing pseudocode and fill in the actual code later. (Coincidentally, this is a reasonable way to write actual code as well).

- Write the Actual Code and Ask if it Looks Good

You should now convert your pseudocode into actual code. You donâ€™t even need to remove the comments. At this point, you just need to plug the appropriate code for your language in. If you forget some syntax or a method name, you should be able to ask your interviewer for this information without too much grief. If they give you trouble, just say youâ€™ll leave it as pseudocode for now.

- Stuck? Ask for Help!

If youâ€™re having trouble along the way, itâ€™s not illegal to ask for some help. Just phrase it conversationally.



# 7 tips to ace a programming interview

- ### Take a few minutes.

What most of those well-meaning advice-givers overlook, however, is that talking and thinking at the same time is extremely hard. Nervous interviewees will jump straight into talking, passing up a great opportunity for concentrated thought.

Don’t waste precious minutes trying to fill the silence by saying everything you’re thinking, while simultaneously trying to solve the problem in your head.

Instead, wait until the interviewer is done explaining the problem.

- ### Write down the steps of the solution.

Even after you have an idea of how to attack the problem, don’t start writing code down. Write down the general steps of how you will solve it on one side of the whiteboard, where it’s visible but won’t get in the way. You don’t need to be verbose, just get the steps in order and somewhat readable.

- ### Write pseudocode first.

Time to write code? Nope. Take a “dry run” at writing the code by writing some pseudocode. Often we run into problems halfway through writing the code, and there’s no point wasting time over syntax when you might have to throw the code away. Instead, write some half-baked code-looking stuff that lays out the structure of how your code will work. Do it over on the side of the whiteboard, so you have space left to work.



- ### Don’t sweat the small stuff.

Programming interviews are not about how well you’ve remembered your semicolons, nor are they about being able to remember all of the flags on a TCP packet. They’re about demonstrating depth and breadth of knowledge, personality strengths, and problem-solving abilities. If you make a mistake, it’s okay. Brush it off and move on.

- ### Sit down. Be humble.

A programming interview isn’t just a written exam. It’s an assessment of your programming abilities, and there are plenty of things that fall into that category beyond mere coding prowess.

- ### Come prepared.

- ### Review your work.

You won’t always finish questions in the time permitted, but occasionally you’ll have extra time after coming up with a solution.

If you have the time, review your code as you would in a peer review. Show the interviewer that you are committed to producing accurate, high-quality work, and that they can trust you to do so without being prompted.
